# simple-exchange-II
This is a follow-up from the previous simple-exchange project that I created.
It reads data from a file called data.csv to obtain orders and then proceeds to execute order matching.
This project was created with the help of this [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=use%20c%20to%20build%20a%20crypto%20trading%20platform%20) 

## How to run
- I developed this using CLION and ran with cMake.
