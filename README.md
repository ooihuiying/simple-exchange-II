# simple-exchange-II
This is a follow-up from the previous simple-exchange project I created.
It reads data from data.csv, parse information and perform bids and asks order matching.
This project was created with the help of following this [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=use%20c%20to%20build%20a%20crypto%20trading%20platform%20) 

## How to run
- I developed this using CLION and run with cMake.
